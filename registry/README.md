# Registry of Patterns and Tools

## Contain 
This registry includes a lightweight library, framework, and a collection of useful patterns.

Currently, `raw-framework` and `raw-library` are not packaged, so for research purposes, Iâ€™m also sharing about the code here.

The `raw-framework` began as an experiment with the `raw-library` on the TON network, particularly for TON Sites, and the development continues.

To advance further, I decided to split the experimental `raw-framework` and `raw-library`, adding several useful using `patterns-react`, `patterns-vanjs`.

So, currently we have pretty stable patterns and experimental patterns, in next section you can research about them.

## Stable patterns

- [React](https://github.com/systemdesigndao/ton-design-system/blob/master/registry/patterns-react/README.md#contain)

- [VanJS](https://github.com/systemdesigndao/ton-design-system/blob/master/registry/patterns-vanjs/README.md#contain)

## Experimental patterns

- [Raw Library Rust Wasm](https://github.com/systemdesigndao/ton-design-system/blob/master/registry/patterns-raw-library-rust-wasm/README.md#contain)

- [Raw Library Wat](https://github.com/systemdesigndao/ton-design-system/blob/master/registry/patterns-raw-library-wat/README.md#contain)

- [Raw Framework](https://github.com/systemdesigndao/ton-design-system/blob/master/registry/raw-framework/README.md#contain)

- [Raw Library](https://github.com/systemdesigndao/ton-design-system/blob/master/registry/raw-library/README.md#contain)
